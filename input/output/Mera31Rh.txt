GEOGRAPHY
PAPER: 1
1. The accompanying map shows a part of Sussex on the scale of one inch to one mile. Describe the main physical features of the region shown on the map, and comment particularly on the course of the Arun north of Arundel, and the past and present drainage of the hill country to the east of that river. What geographical factors have controlled the directions taken by the main lines of communication shown on the map? Without drawing a full section, say whether it is possible to see Arundel from the top of Harrow Hill. Write a brief note on the situation of towns or villages along the Arun valley.
2. What projection would you choose for a map required for a flight across the Atlantic, a study of the Arctic regions, or a report on the distribution of cotton-producing areas? Give reasons for your choice.
3. Discuss any two of the following statements: Nain on the east coast of Labrador is 1° further south than Aberdeen, but Aberdeen has a January temperature of 38° F., while that of Nain is -7° F. Alexandria at the mouth of the Nile receives no rain from May to September, inclusive; Shanghai in about the same latitude on the coast of China receives 26 inches during the same period. In January the mean temperature of Cape Wrath in the north of Scotland is 40° F., while that of Florence, in peninsular Italy, is only 1° higher.
