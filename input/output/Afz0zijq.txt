PAPER 1
1. After studying the part of the Ordnance Survey map which is provided: Write a brief description (not more than 12 lines) of the relief of the area. On a sketch-map make a simple division of the whole area into two regions: predominantly rural settlement and predominantly urban settlement. Relate this division of settlement to your description of relief. Comment on the position of Guisborough (610160).
2. On the accompanying map of part of the world: Give the exact latitude of the northern and southern edges of the map. Insert the Prime Meridian. Mark, with arrows to show direction, and name the ocean currents of that part of the Atlantic Ocean shown on the map and the winds of the Indian Ocean during July. Delimit the areas of equatorial forest. Mark, with the letter given in brackets, areas noted for the production of rubber (R), coffee (C), tea (T) and palm oil (P). Mark and name the new capital city of Brazil and the mineral producing areas known as Katanga and Bauchi.
3. Express the following scales in terms of either inches to the mile or miles to the inch whichever is appropriate: 1/253,440; 1/10,560; 1/1,000,000. How does the detail of maps on scales (i) and (ii) differ from that of maps on the scale of 1:63,360? Restrict your examples to Ordnance Survey maps.
