PAPER: 1
1. The accompanying map shows a part of the Spey valley, from below Kingussie to the vicinity of Aviemore, with the surrounding country: Write a careful, detailed, description of the part of the Spey valley shown. Note and explain the symbols used in the area upstream from Loch Insh, and point out the drainage peculiarities of Loch Alvie. Describe broadly, and so far as possible explain, the distribution of woodland in the area. Making use both of the symbols employed on the map, and of your previous knowledge of the Scottish Highlands, describe also the probable nature of the woodland. Discuss, giving reasons, the position of the lines of communication (railway, roads, paths), and add notes on the distribution of population.
2. State, in broadest outline, the main facts in regard to the geology of Scotland, and point out the chief ways in which the geological structure affects the life of man in the country, adding a short note on the rocks of England as compared with those of Scotland. State, giving a physical explanation, the chief causes to which rain is due, and illustrate by describing the distribution of precipitation over a mountain-range exposed to warm, moisture-laden winds.
3. In what chief parts of Continental Europe are the following crop-plants grown on a large scaleâ€”flax, maize, mulberry, vine? Give reasons and state what becomes of the product in each case.
4. Describe shortly the country traversed by the Rhine and estimate the importance of the river as a waterway.
5. Discuss the causes which have led to the rise of Glasgow as a great commercial city, comparing it in this respect with Dundee and Aberdeen.
