GEOGRAPHY
PAPER: 2
1. The accompanying map shows the Kyle of Tongue and Ben Loyal in Sutherland: a. Describe generally the land and coast forms represented on the map, pointing out typical features that seem to be due to glaciation, to the action of rivers, to the work of waves and currents. b. Describe the view which can be seen by an observer looking southwards from the point marked A. c. Calculate the distance saved between Tongue House, marked B, and Achuvoldrach, marked C, by crossing the Kyle at Tongue Ferry, instead of following the road round the head of the Kyle. Assuming the roads to be evenly graded between adjacent contours or marked altitudes, mark with crosses the sections of the road between B and C where the gradient exceeds 1 in 20. d. What indications does the map afford of the distribution and probable occupations of the people in this district? Point out any advantages in the situation of Tongue.
2. Compare the Mollweide and Mercator projections for a world map. Contrast especially the manner in which they represent the tropical zones, the polar zones, regions near the central meridian, and regions about 180 degrees from the central meridian. What special advantages does each possess?
3. Contrast the coniferous forests of the North Temperate Zone with the tropical rain-forests. State the distribution of each; describe their characteristic climates and their chief economic products.
4. At what seasons would you expect the following rivers to be in flood: Obi, Nile, Hwang-ho, Tiber? What are the causes and consequences of these seasonal floodings?
