PAPER: 2
1. What characters in The Merchant of Venice or As You Like It or Twelfth Night or The Tempest seem to you to be punished more than they deserve or to be let off too lightly? It has been said that several of Shakespeare's tragic heroes come to disaster because they do not know themselves, their own real characters, and their own motives. With this idea in mind, discuss the fate of any one of the following: Richard II, Brutus, Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear. Trace the influence of supernatural factors (ghosts, witches, apparitions, portents, etc.) on the course of the action of one of the following plays: Julius Caesar, Hamlet, Macbeth, The Tempest. What does the plot gain or lose by the introduction of these factors?
2. "Chaucer loved bright colours." Develop this statement and prove it as fully as you can from The Prologue to the Canterbury Tales. Give as accurately and as neatly as you can the gist of any one of The Canterbury Tales which you have read.
3. "The metre employed is more appropriate to the spirit of L'Allegro than to that of Il Penseroso, but the latter poem better expresses the character of the poet and is, on the whole, a better poem." How far do you agree with this judgement?
4. Write a brief account of one poem and one prose work from the following list, giving in each case the name of the author and his approximate date: Absalom and Achitophel, Annals of the Parish, Eothen, Grantchester, Green Mansions, Ode to Duty, Sohrab and Rustum, The Deserted Village, The Voyage of the Beagle, Travels with a Donkey.
5. Describe the picture of Scottish rural life in the eighteenth century presented in one of the following poems: The Cotter’s Saturday Night, The Twa Dogs, Tam O’Shanter.
6. Tell what you know of the patriotic poems of any two of the following: Milton, Campbell, Wordsworth, Tennyson, Kipling, Sir Henry Newbolt.
