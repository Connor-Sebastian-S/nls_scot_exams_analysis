PAPER 1
1. The following table gives the latitude and the mean annual temperature of various places in North America and Europe. Locate the towns where the country is not already given, and tell what inferences you draw from the table as to the comparative warmth of the east and west coasts of the North Atlantic; of places in Europe in the same latitude but at various distances from the North Atlantic. How are these differences accounted for?
2. Contrast the East and West of Scotland in respect of configuration, climate and natural resources.
3. Make a sketch map of England and the South of Scotland as far as to the Forth. On this map mark the mountain ranges (or groups), and the great railway lines from London to Edinburgh and Glasgow. What causes have determined the courses of these lines?
4. What geographical or historical reasons help to account for the greatness of four of the following cities: Glasgow, Liverpool, Berlin, Constantinople, Alexandria, Bombay, Chicago, Montreal, Rio de Janeiro?
