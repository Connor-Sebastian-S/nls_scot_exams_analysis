PAPER: 1
1. Write out, and punctuate, the passage for dictation.
2. Write an essay, of about two pages, on one of the following subjects: An imaginary letter from an American boy or girl, describing a first visit to Scotland; The adventures of an umbrella.
3. Express, in your own language, the sense of the given passage.
4. Analyse the second stanza of the above passage, from “Ah” to “time.” Write brief notes on the words italicised in the above passage, showing how each of them illustrates the way in which English words are built up, and giving in each case another word similarly formed.
5. Write five or more sentences, to illustrate important distinctions of usage between: “Shall” and “will”; “Middle” and “centre”; “Few” and “a few”; “Verbal” and “oral”; “Last” and “latest.”
6. Show, with examples, how the English language tends to become simpler in structure by the disuse of old inflections, the substitution of a familiar form for an unfamiliar one, the use of an additional word in place of an inflection.
7. Rewrite each of the given sentences in correct and unambiguous form. Point out the nature of the faults, drawing special attention to such words or clauses as cannot be analysed or can be analysed in more ways than one.
8. Give an account, with quotation, of any celebrated English ballad or short narrative poem.
