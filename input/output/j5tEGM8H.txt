I know not which way I must look For comfort being as I am opprest To think that now our life is only drest For show; mean handiwork of craftsman cook Or groom!â€”We must run glittering like a brook In the open sunshine or we are unblest; The wealthiest man among us is the best: No grandeur now in Nature or in book Delights us. Rapine avarice expense This is idolatry; and these we adore: Plain living and high thinking are no more; The homely beauty of the good old cause Is gone; our peace our fearful innocence And pure religion breathing household laws. Name and describe the metrical structure of the above poem. What is meant by the heroic measure (or iambic pentameter) and by the romantic measure (or iambic tetrameter)?
