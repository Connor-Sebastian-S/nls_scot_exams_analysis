Give the meaning and derivation of the words: literally, atrophy, deterioration, sociologist, manual, physical, garnished.
2. Identify "he" (line 2) and "the flower" (line 1) in Wordsworth's poem. Explain why "glinted" is in inverted commas. Paraphrase lines 3-6 of the first stanza. Parse "grieved" (line 8) and explain the metaphor in lines 11-12.
3. Rewrite the following sentences with their faults corrected: Custom officials have the right neither to seize books or pamphlets at the ports which they consider improper. Neither he nor his brother go to a large boyâ€™s school. He continues to remain in Holland, one of the few countries which has not taken part in the War. He went away without me knowing anything about it. To do all this in ten minutes seems to me to be exceedingly short.
4. List the words wrongly used by Mrs. Malaprop in the extract and write the correct replacements. Construct sentences showing proper usage of all misused words.
