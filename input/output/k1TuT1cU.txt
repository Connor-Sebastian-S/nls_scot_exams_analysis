PAPER: 3
1. Describe the death of any one of Shakespeare’s tragic heroes and show why it excites more admiration than regret. Sketch the character of Sir John Falstaff, Bottom, Sir Toby Belch, Touchstone, Benedick, Puck, or Caliban as they would appear on stage. Illustrate Shakespeare’s use of song, music, and dance in his plays.
2. Show how a pilgrimage setting for the Canterbury Tales suits Chaucer’s genius. Explain why Spenser's poetry might attract readers.
3. Was Arnold right in calling Pope "the poet of an age of prose"? Explain his meaning.
4. Write a short appreciation of a satire by Dryden, a sonnet by Wordsworth, a song by Burns, an ode by Keats, a lyric by Shelley, a dramatic idyll by Browning, or a short poem by Hardy with quotations.
5. Give an account of an essay by Addison, Lamb, or Stevenson, highlighting stylistic characteristics.
6. Describe two characters from: Madge Wildfire, Mr. Squeers, Miss Matty, Olivia Primrose, Maggie Tulliver, Mr. Collins, Becky Sharp, John Ridd, or Soames Forsyte. Mention their books, authors, and approximate dates.
