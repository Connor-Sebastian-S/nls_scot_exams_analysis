GEOGRAPHY
PAPER: 1
1. The accompanying map shows a part of the Tweed valley with the lower courses of the Gala, Leader, and Ettrick Waters: Write a careful description of the drainage of the area shown, with particular reference to the relation between the river valleys and the lines of communication, both roads and railways. Describe very carefully the position of Galashiels, Melrose, and Earlston, illustrating by contoured sketch-maps. What deductions can be drawn from the map as to the present relative importance of these three places and the probable occupations of their inhabitants? Write a description of the Eildon Hills, making diagrams to show the relative steepness of their slopes in different directions.
2. Compare the industries carried on respectively in the South Wales coalfield and the Northumberland and Durham coalfield, explaining the differences so far as you can. Illustrate by sketch-maps.
3. Select an area within the British Isles characterised by the predominance of one of the following kinds of rock: chalk; massive limestones; clays; metamorphic rocks. In the case selected describe the relief and scenery and discuss the effects of the geology on human life.
