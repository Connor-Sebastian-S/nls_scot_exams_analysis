PAPER: 1
1. Write a Composition, not exceeding three foolscap pages length, on any one of the following subjects: The main arguments for or against home lessons. "Reading maketh a full man." Describe some of the benefits you have obtained from your reading of books both in school and at home. A description, in the form of a letter to a friend, of a castle or a youth hostel or a factory or a farm. British and American filmsâ€”a contrast. Housekeeping in wartime. Imagine that you had served with Hannibal in the crossing of the Alps, or with Montrose in the Civil War, or with Field Marshal Montgomery in his North African campaign, and give an account of your adventures.
2. Write a summary, as far as possible in your own words, of the substance of the given passage, and suggest a title for the passage. Explain carefully the following phrases as used in the passage: The art of social life; founders of schools; the intellectual tone of society; to discard what is irrelevant; less susceptible of method. What single word may be used to describe one "who sees things as they are"? What word is used in the opposite sense? What is the precise meaning of the phrase "to disentangle a skein of thought"? What type of genius is represented by each of the three pairs of proper names "of Aristotles or Newtons, of Napoleons or Washingtons, of Raphaels or Shakespeares"? Make a general analysis into clauses of the last sentence "The art which tends ... in its result."
3. Write sentences which not only include but bring out clearly the meaning of the following words: fabulous, bigot, effective, abate, shifty. Rewrite the following passage with correct punctuation: "I can't quote," I said, "a single line of Milton's L'Allegro though I know the poem well." "But surely," he said, "you can remember a phrase or two. What about, for instance, the lines beginning 'And ever against eating cares lap me in soft Lydian airs'?"
