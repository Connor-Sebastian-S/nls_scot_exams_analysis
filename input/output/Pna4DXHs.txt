GEOGRAPHY
PAPER: 1
1. After studying the map, give a brief and broad description of the build of the area shown, distinguishing three main regions. How is the distribution of population (in villages and in scattered dwellings) related to relief? Write a note on the north-eastern end of the reservoir, Llyn Cowlyd. Compare—briefly—the courses followed by the river, road, and railway through the Vale of Conway. What are likely to be the main occupations of the people at or near Capel-Curig (D2)? Why?
2. On the accompanying map of North and South America: Indicate by arrows the main coastal currents and drifts north of the Equator, and name them. Delimit carefully two areas of tropical grasslands and two of temperate grasslands, marking each “tropical” or “temperate” as the case may be. Name each of the grasslands shown. Put a ring round each of two areas of South America where the annual rainfall is small. Mark each area “dry.” Insert and name the Panama, Soo, and Welland Canals.
