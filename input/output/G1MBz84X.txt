3. Give a general grammatical analysis of the second sentence, from “To the noisy rout” to “loses health.”
4. Give simpler equivalents for “votaries,” “bacchanalian,” “alleviate,” “protracted,” “resuscitate”; and give the derivation of these words if you can.

10. Write a sentence about each of the proper names in the Sonnet (except “Pacific”).
11. By altering, not the words themselves, but only their order, re-write the following passage so as to form a series of rhyming octo-syllabic couplets: “He passed by many a mountain stream cast from the tall cliffs in tumult, dashing their dun waters to foam, and sparkling in the summer sun. The wild curlew flew round his grey head in many a fearless circle.”
12. What do the following figurative expressions mean, and from what sciences or arts are they derived? (a) “Newton was now at the zenith of his powers.” (b) “At this news our hopes, which had been steadily rising, sank to zero.” (c) “Trial by jury is the keystone of British liberties.”
