GEOGRAPHY
PAPER: 1
1. (a) Describe the part of the county shown, with careful reference to the sites of the villages and other settlements. Why is the coastal strip scantily peopled and what occupations are the inhabitants likely to follow? (b) Compare the course of the main railway and the accompanying highroad so far as they are shown on the map, pointing out the main differences between the line followed in the two cases. Show, by any method you please, the precise difference in gradient between the two in the regions where they diverge most widely.
2. Give a careful geographical description, illustrated by a sketch-map, either of N.E. England (that is, the area to the east of the Pennines between the Tweed and the Humber), or of Ireland, north of a line from Donegal Bay to Dundalk Bay.
3. Compare the east and west coasts of Scotland, north of a line from Forth to Clyde, as to climate, products and occupations of the inhabitants, and account for the differences between them.
4. Describe the characters of the chief vegetation belts of Europe, and relate their distribution to the various types of climate represented in the continent.
5. Explain in detail how you would use either (1) a prismatic compass to make a survey of a winding road, or (2) a plane table to make a sketch-map of a small area.
6. Name the chief coalfields of continental Europe, indicate the outstanding industries carried on on each field mentioned, and point out the advantages which favour these in each case.
