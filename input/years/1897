Some seek diversion in the tented field, And make the sorrows of mankind their sport. But war’s a game which, were their subjects wise, Kings would not play at.

2. Paraphrase the following poem, so as to bring out the full meaning: When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past, I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow, For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night, And weep afresh love’s long-since-cancelled woe, And moan the expense of many a vanish’d sight. Then can I grieve at grievances foregone, And heavily from woe to woe tell o’er The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan, Which I new pay as if not paid before: —But if the while I think on thee, dear Friend, All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
