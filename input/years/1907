1. The great chieftains of Ulster, who, at the time of James’s accession, had submitted to the royal authority, had not long brooked the humiliation of dependence. They had conspired against the English Government, and had been found guilty of treason. Their immense domains had been forfeited to the Crown, and had soon been peopled by thousands of English and Scotch emigrants. On a sudden the aboriginal population rose on the colonists. A war, to which national and theological hatred gave a character of peculiar ferocity, desolated Ulster, and spread to the neighbouring provinces. Every post brought to London exaggerated accounts of outrages which, without any exaggeration, were sufficient to move pity and horror. These evil tidings roused to the height the zeal of both the great parties which were marshalled against each other at Westminster.
