Where men of judgment creep and feel their way, The positive pronounce without dismay, Their want of right and intellect supplied By sparks absurdity strikes out of pride.

This happy England, loud with brooks and birds, Shining with harvests; cool with dewy trees And bloomed from hill to dell, but whose best flowers Are daughters, and Ophelia still more fair Than any rose she weaves; whose noblest floods The pulsing torrent of a nation’s heart; Whose forests stronger than her native oaks Are living men; and whose unfathomed lakes, For ever calm, the unforgotten dead In quiet graveyards willowed seemly round, O’er which To-day bends sad, and sees his face; Whose rocks are rights, consolidate of old Through unremembered years, around whose base The ever-surging peoples roll and roar Perpetual, as around her cliffs the seas That only wash them whiter!

Simplicity is one of the features of Macbeth’s nature, who has no command over his mind or his features. She is one of those women who cannot conceal her opinions about what she considers to be wrong. The sparring with words between Beatrice, who says “nobody marks you,” and yet she herself does, and Benedick makes us wonder how all that will end. The entrance of the two women, Nerissa first, then Portia, forms one of the most striking climaxes anywhere to be imagined, and adds to the dramatic effect.
