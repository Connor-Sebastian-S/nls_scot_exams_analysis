8. "Comedy generally shows us the exposure of some folly, hypocrisy or affectation. With this in English Comedy a love-story is often blended." Illustrate this from such comedies as Much Ado, The School for Scandal, &c.; or from such novels as Emma, Vanity Fair, Martin Chuzzlewit, Evan Harrington, &c. Try to show how the comedy and the love-story are blended.
