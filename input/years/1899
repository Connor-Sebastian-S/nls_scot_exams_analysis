At length his sovereign frowns ; the train of state Mark the keen glance, and watch the sign to hate. Where’er he turns, he meets a stranger’s eye ; His suppliants scorn him, and his followers fly.

Paraphrase the following lines, so as to bring out their full meaning: Hackneyed in business, wearied at the oar, Which thousands, once fast chained to, quit no more, But which, when life at ebb runs weak and low, All wish, or seem to wish, they could forego ; The statesman, lawyer, merchant, man of trade, Pants for the refuge of some rural shade, Where, all his long anxieties forgot Among the charms of a sequestered spot, Or recollected only to gild o’er And add a smile to what was sweet before, He may possess the joys he thinks he sees, Lay his old age upon the lap of Ease, Improve the remnant of his wasted span, And, having lived a trifler, die a man.
