1. Prove that the angle at the centre of a circle is twice any angle at the circumference standing on the same arc.
2. Prove that the internal bisector of an angle of a triangle divides the opposite side in the ratio of the sides containing the angle bisected.
3. Two circles with centres A and B and radii R and r respectively cut at C and D as shown in the accompanying diagram, and CD cuts AB produced at M. If AB is 2 units in length and BM 3 units, prove that R² – r² = 16. If, also, R² + r² = 10, find the value of R – r, and deduce the lengths of the radii of the circles.
4. ABC and CBD are adjacent angles of sizes a° and b° respectively, a being greater than b, and BX is the bisector of the angle ABD. Calculate the size of the angle XBC in terms of a and b. N is a fixed point on a circle with centre O and radius 6 inches. ON is produced its own length to a point A. P is a point on the circle. State the locus of the mid-point of AP as P moves round the circle. Draw a straight line AB 2 inches long. Without using tables, construct an angle at A whose cosine is 2/5. State briefly the construction. In a triangle ABC, BC = 3.5 inches, angle ABC = 25°, and angle ACB = 53°. Calculate the length of AC.

GEOGRAPHY
PAPER 1
1. After studying the part of the Ordnance Survey map which is provided: Write a brief description (not more than 12 lines) of the relief of the area. On a sketch-map make a simple division of the whole area into two regions: predominantly rural settlement and predominantly urban settlement. Relate this division of settlement to your description of relief. Comment on the position of Guisborough (610160).
2. On the accompanying map of part of the world: Give the exact latitude of the northern and southern edges of the map. Insert the Prime Meridian. Mark, with arrows to show direction, and name the ocean currents of that part of the Atlantic Ocean shown on the map and the winds of the Indian Ocean during July. Delimit the areas of equatorial forest. Mark, with the letter given in brackets, areas noted for the production of rubber (R), coffee (C), tea (T) and palm oil (P). Mark and name the new capital city of Brazil and the mineral producing areas known as Katanga and Bauchi.
3. Express the following scales in terms of either inches to the mile or miles to the inch whichever is appropriate: 1/253,440; 1/10,560; 1/1,000,000. How does the detail of maps on scales (i) and (ii) differ from that of maps on the scale of 1:63,360? Restrict your examples to Ordnance Survey maps.
